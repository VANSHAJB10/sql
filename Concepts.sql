/* NULL */

* A NULL value is different from a zero value or a field that contains spaces. 
* A field with a NULL value is one that has been left blank during record creation.

* It is not possible to test for NULL values with comparison operators, such as =, <, or <> ;  'IS NULL' and 'IS NOT NULL' operators are used instead.


/* SELECT TOP */
* The SELECT TOP clause is used to specify the number of records to return.

* SELECT TOP 3 * FROM Customers;  /* Selects the first three records from the "Customers" table */
