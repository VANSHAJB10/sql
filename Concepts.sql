/* NULL */

* A NULL value is different from a zero value or a field that contains spaces. 
* A field with a NULL value is one that has been left blank during record creation.

* It is not possible to test for NULL values with comparison operators, such as =, <, or <> ;  'IS NULL' and 'IS NOT NULL' operators are used instead.
